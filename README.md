Online Ticket Booking System
This is a simple console-based ticket booking system built using Python. The system provides users with the ability to log in, book tickets for events, and view their booking history. It simulates a basic online ticket booking experience in a text-based interface.

Features
User Login: Users can log in with a predefined username and password.

Ticket Booking: After logging in, users can book tickets by providing event details (date, description, price).
View Transactions: Users can view a list of all their ticket bookings.

Logout: Users can log out from the system.

Usage
Run the Python script in a console or terminal.

Log in with the predefined credentials.
Book tickets, view your transactions, or log out.

Future Enhancements
Add data persistence (e.g., save bookings to a file or database).
Implement an admin interface to manage bookings.
Introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.
